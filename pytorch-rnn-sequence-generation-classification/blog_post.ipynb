Yes, we can compute the probabily of occurance of each letter from our training corpus (number of times a letter occures divided by the size of our dataset) and randomly sample letter using these probabilities. This model is better but it totally ignores the relative positional aspect of each letter. For example, pay attention on how you read any word: you start with the first letter, which is usually hard to predict, but as you reach the end of a word you can sometimes guess the next letter. When you read any word you are implicitly using some rules which you learned by reading other texts: for example, with each additional letter that you read from a word, the probability of a space character increases (really long words are rare) or the probability of any consonant after the letter \"r\" is low as it usually followed by vowel. There are lot of similar rules and we hope that our model will be able to learn them from data. To give our model a chance to learn these rules we need to extend it.\n",

We can also estimate the probability distribution $p(current~letter|previous~letter)$ from our training dataset. This model is limited because in most cases the probability of the current letter depends not only on the previous letter.\n",

    "Now let's look at our problem from the gpu memory consumption and speed point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "We greatly speed up computation by processing our sequences in batches. At the same time, as\n",
    "our sequences become longer (depending on the dataset), our max batch size starts to decrease.\n",
    "Why is it a case? As we use backpropagation to compute gradients, we need to store all the intermediate acitvations, which contribute the most to the memory consumption. As our sequence becomes longer, we need to store more activations, therefore, we can fit less examples in our batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we either have to work with really long sequences or we want to increase our batch size or maybe you just have a gpu with small amount of memory available. There are multiple possible solutions to reduce memory\n",
    "consumption in this case, but we will mention two, which will have different trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First one is a [truncated back propagation](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-key-difference-between-backprop-and-truncated-backprop-through-time#sLRGO). The idea is to split the whole sequence into subsequences and treat\n",
    "them as separate batches with an exception that we process these batches in the order of split and every next batch uses hidden state of previous batch as an initial hidden state. We also provide an implementation of this approach, so that you can get the better understanding. This approach is obviously not an exact equivalent of processing the whole sequence but it makes more frequent updates and consumes less memory. On the other hand, there is a chance that we might not be able to capture long-term dependencies that span beyond the length of one subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second one is [gradient checkpointing](https://medium.com/@yaroslavvb/fitting-larger-networks-into-memory-583e3c758ff9). This method gives us a possibilty to use less memory while training our model on the whole sequence on the expence of performing more computation. If you recall, previously we mentioned that the most memory during\n",
    "training is occupied by activations. The idea of gradient checkpointing consists of storing only every $n$-th activation and recomputing the unsaved activations later. This method is already [implemented in Tensorflow](https://github.com/openai/gradient-checkpointing) and [being implemented in Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/4594).\n",
